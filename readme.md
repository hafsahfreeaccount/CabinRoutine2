## Introduction 
Cabin routine is a pixel style caretaker simulation game where the player manages and maintains a small cabin environment. The player must complete daily tasks such as cleaning, repairing, feeding animals, and managing resources while balancing time and energy. There is no combat. A failure state when the needs are not met for example energy or lack of resources. The project’s aim is to create a low stress experience where the player finds meaning in simple tasks. Through exploration of the game the player uncovers a story told entirely through environment and audio feedback.

## Coding techniques
## Research
Several games were analysed to identify key features that can be applied to the project. These games were selected because they focus on routine based gameplay, environmental interaction and relaxing mechanics. By comparing their features, the inclusion of systems such as cleaning, repairng and daily tasks in the game is justified. 

### Unpacking
Features: Object placement, organising items, calm gameplay
Why it suits my game: Supports cleaning/ tidying mechanics and shows that simple tasks can be satisfying without pressure

### House Flipper 
Features: Cleaning, repairing, tool based interactions, visible before/after changes 
How it compliments the game: Justifies including repair and maintenance tasks with clear visual progress

### Stardew Valley 
Features: Daily routine, resource management, gradual progression 
How it compliments the game: Supports a structured daily loop where the player maintains the cabin over time

### Animal crossing: New Horizons 
Features: Relaxed gameplay customisation, open-ended tasks 
How it compliments the game: Reinforces a cozy, low pressure experience with player freedom

### Cozy Grove
Features: Daily tasks, environment restoration, simple objectives
How it suits the game: Supports routine-based gameplay and gradual improvement of the environment
## User requirements
Functional requirements
| Requirement | Description |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| Movement system | Player movement in 4 directions. WASD or arrow keys movement. Consistent movement speed |
| Interaction System | System detects when player is in range of interactive objects |
| State Persistence | System saves the state of all interactive objects, recording if any changes have been made. |
| Audio Trigger system | The system monitors player location and action history to trigger matching audios. | 
| Inventory system | System tracks six items carried by player and displayed in grid format. |
| Save System | System serialises game state to JSON format and writes it to local storage. Multiple saves are supported. | 
| Day Cycle | System has four distint backgrounds dependent on the tasks that are completed |
| Weather system | System will occasionally have a rainy state with appropriate audio changes. |
| Subtitle System | Subtitles will be displayed for all effects when enabled. | 

## Scrum style stories
1. As a player, I want to move my character through the environment so that I can explore the cabin and surrounding areas.
2. As a player, I want to interact with objects in the world so that I can clean and repair the space.
3. As a player, I want the game to remember what I have cleaned or fixed so that my progress feels permanent and meaningful.
4. As a player, I want to hear audio fragments as I explore to that I can gradually understand the story of who lived here.
5. As a player, I want to access my inventory so that I can see what tools and discovered items I am carrying.
6. As a player, I want to save my progress so that I can return to the game later without losing what I have accomplished.
7. As a player, I want the day to gradually cycle through the morning, afternoon, evening and night so that the world feels alive and changes mood.
8. As a player, I want weather to occasionally change so that the environment feels dynamic and varied.
9. As a player, I want subtitles for all audio so that I can understand the narrative if I have hearing difficulties.

## Development Strategy
### Evaluation of strategies
Several software development strategies were considered including Waterfall, Spiral, Extreme Programming (XP) and Scrum. 
#### Waterfall methodology 
This methodology has a linear approach. Each stage must be completed before moving onto the next. (Requirements, analysis, design, development, testing, deployment)

Strengths:
- Provides a clear structure and documentation
- Easy to manage
- Ensures all requirements are defined before development begins

Weaknesses:
- Not flexible- (changes are difficult once a stage has been complete)
- Does not support experimentation which is important in game design
- Testing occurs late so issues are discovered too late

Evaluation: 
This methodology is not suitable. Game development requires experimentation and iteration. Especially when refining gameplay systems. Part of development involved learning Godot requirements changed over time. A rigid structure like waterfall would have limited creativity and slowed progress. 

#### Spiral methodology 
The spiral model combines iterative development with risk analysis. It progresses through repeated cycles (planning, risk analysis, development, evaluation)

Strengths:
- Strong focus on risk management
- Supports iterative development and continuous improvement
- Allows feedback at each stage

Weaknesses:
- Can be complex and time consuming to manage
- Requires detailed planning and risk assesment
- Not ideal for small project due to overhead

Evaluation:
The spiral model would work as some aspects align with the projects needs. Its iterative nature aligns well with game development, especially for testing gameplay ideas. However, the level of risk analysis and documentation required would be excessive for a small project. It would likely slow development rather than improve it. 

#### Extreme Programming (XP)
Extreme programming (XP) is an Agile methodology focused on high quality code, frequent releases. The development strategy consists of pair programming and continuous testing. 

Strengths: 
- Encourages clean, efficient code and regular testing
- Supports rapid feedback and continuous feedback
- Promotes adaptability to changing requirements

Weaknesses:
- Relies heavilty on team collaboration (pair programming)
- Can be difficault to follow strictly without experience
- Requires consisten discipline and time commitment

 Evaluation: 
 XP would be partially effective, mainly its focus on iteration and testing. However, key practices like pair programming are not relevant in this project. Some XP principles such as frequent testing and small updates, could improve quality, but the full methodology is not practical for a solo-developed game. 

#### Scrum Methodology 
Scrum is an agile framework that organises work into sprints, with tasks managed in a baclog and reviewed regularly. 

Strengths:
- Highly flexible and adaptable to change
- Encourages regular progress tracking through sprint and reviews
- Helps prioritise tasks using a backlog
- Suitable for iterative development

Weaknesses:
- Requires discipline in maintaining backlog and sprint reviews
- Can be less effective if not followed consistently
- Designed for teams, so some roles are less relevant in solo work (e.g. Scrum Master)

Evaluation:
Scrum was the most suitable methodology for this project. It allowed development to adapt when progres was slow in the early stages due to learning Godot. The use of a backlog and sprint structure helped organise tasks and prioritise essential features. Although not all Scrum elements were fully implemented, it supported flexible and iterative development, which is ideal for game creation. 
## Programming language
## User interface and controls
## Game loop
The player observes the environment, noticing elements that draw their attention. They choose to act, using appropriate tools to clean or repair what they have noticed. Completing actions reveal discoveries, physical objects or audio fragments. The player reflects on what they have found and the cycle continues organically based on their curiosity. 

## Character 
## Artwork 
## Game Rules
| Rule | Implementation | Rationale |
|----- | -------------- | --------- |
| Energy depletion | Each action consumes energy. Reaching zero triggers respawn | Creates gentle consequence without severe punishment |
| Time progresion | Actions advance time. Certain tasks available at certain times | Encourages varied play patterns |
| Task optionality | No required objectives 
## Gameplay 
## Backlog
The product backlog was organised using the MoSCow method (Must have, Should have, Could have, Won't have). This prioritisation framework ensured that critical features were delivered even if the scope needed adjustment.
