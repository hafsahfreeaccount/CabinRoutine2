1.0 Introduction
1.1 Project overview
Cabin routine is a pixel style caretaker simulation game where the player manages and maintains a small cabin environment. The player must complete daily tasks such as cleaning, repairing, feeding animals, and managing resources while balancing time and energy. There is no combat. A failure state when the needs are not met for example energy or lack of resources. The project’s aim is to create a low stress experience where the player finds meaning in simple tasks. Through exploration of the game the player uncovers a story told entirely through environment and audio feedback.
